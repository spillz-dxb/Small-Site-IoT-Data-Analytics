Basic Statistics Terms
* Bayes Rule:
	* Likelihood P(Data|theta)
		* Probability of the date could be generated by a model with
			the given parameter(s)
	* Prior P(theta)
		* Probability of parameter value
	* Posterior P(theta|D)
		* Credibility of the parameter value with the data taken into account.
	* Marginal Likelihood (Evidence)
		* Probability of evidence
* Variance
	* Spread of the data
	* Distance from the mean
* Standard Deviation
	* Square root of the variance
	* Same units as the data
* Mean
	* Average/Expected Value
* Covariance
	* Measure of how two random values change together
		* Negative - variables show opposite behaviour
			* Example: As A increases B decreases
		* Positive - variables show similar behaviour
			* Example: As A increases B increases
* Pearson Correlation
	* Normalized version of covariance 
* Median
	* Number at the halfway point of the dataset 
		* found through sorting data into ascending order and selecting middle point
* Mode
	* Most frequent value in dataset
* Note about Populations and Samples
	*Populations have parameters
	* Samples have statistics
* Distributions
	* Normal/Gaussian
		* Parameters
			* mean
			* standard deviation
		* Bell shape
		* Other terms associated:
			* z-score: indicates how many standard deviations an element is
				from the mean
	* Student t
		* Description: used to estimate the mean of a normally distributed population
			where the sample size is small and the standard deviation is unknown
		* t-score: t = [ x - Î¼ ] / [ s / sqrt( n ) ]
			* indicator of the probability which represents the likelihood of finding
				a sample mean less than ore equal to the calculated sample mean given 
				a random sample size of n
		* degrees of freedom: n-1
	* Bernoulli
	* Binomial
