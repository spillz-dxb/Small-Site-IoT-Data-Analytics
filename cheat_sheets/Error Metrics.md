* [Precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall): Fraction of retrieved instances that are relavant
  * Also known as positive predictive value

* [Recall] (http://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/8089/why-doesnt-recall-take-into-account-true-negatives): Primarily used
  as a metric in information retrieval. Refers to the fraction of relevant instances that were retrieved. 
  * AKA sensitivity
  
# Hypothesis Testing

  * Type II error;
