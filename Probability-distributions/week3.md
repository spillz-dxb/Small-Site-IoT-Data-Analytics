# Introduction to probability
In statistics, outcomes are said to be random if they are uncertain but, in the long run, form a distribution. The classic case of tossing a coin and observing either a head or tail is uncertain for a small number of coin tosses, but approaches the limit of 50% heads and 50% tails for many coin tosses as depicted in Figure 1
