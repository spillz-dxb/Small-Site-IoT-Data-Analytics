Variables that have are measured on a numeric or quantitative scale. Ordinal, interval and ratio scales are quantitative. A country’s population, a person’s shoe size, or a car’s speed are all quantitative variables. Variables that are not quantitative are known as qualitative variables.

## Categorical Variables

As the name suggests, categorical variables are those variables that fall into a particular category. Hair color, gender, college major, college attended, political affiliation, disability, or sexual orientation are all categories that could have lists of categorical variables. Usually, the variables take on one of a number of fixed variables in a set.

For example:
The category “hair color” could contain the categorical variables “black,” “brown,” “blonde,” and “red.”
The category “gender” could contain the categorical variables “Male”, “Female”, or “Other.
