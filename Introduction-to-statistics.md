 1) quantitative (Numerical data. for example hight as a number)
 2) categorical or quantitative (for example high as small or large)
 3) nominal 
 4) ordinal
 
 
 ## Quantitative Variable

Variables that have are measured on a numeric or quantitative scale. Ordinal, interval and ratio scales are quantitative. A country’s population, a person’s shoe size, or a car’s speed are all quantitative variables. Variables that are not quantitative are known as qualitative variables.

## Categorical Variables

http://www.statisticshowto.com/what-is-a-categorical-variable/

As the name suggests, categorical variables are those variables that fall into a particular category. Hair color, gender, college major, college attended, political affiliation, disability, or sexual orientation are all categories that could have lists of categorical variables. Usually, the variables take on one of a number of fixed variables in a set.

For example:
The category “hair color” could contain the categorical variables “black,” “brown,” “blonde,” and “red.”
The category “gender” could contain the categorical variables “Male”, “Female”, or “Other.


## Definition of Nominal Variable

http://www.statisticshowto.com/nominal-variable/

A nominal variable is another name for a categorical variable. Nominal variables have two or more categories without having any kind of natural order. they are variables with no numeric value, such as occupation or political party affiliation. Another way of thinking about nominal variables is that they are named (nominal is from Latin nominalis, meaning pertaining to names).

### Nominal variables:

Cannot be quantified. In other words, you can’t perform arithmetic operations on them, like addition or subtraction, or logical operations like “equal to” or “greater than” on them.
Cannot be assigned any order.


### Examples of Nominal Variables
Gender (Male, Female, Transgender).
Eye color (Blue, Green, Brown, Hazel).
Type of house (Bungalow, Duplex, Ranch).
Type of pet (Dog, Cat, Rodent, Fish, Bird).
Genotype ( AA, Aa, or aa).


## Ordinal variable



Ordinal
With ordinal scales, it is the order of the values is what’s important and significant, but the differences between each one is not really known.  Take a look at the example below.  In each case, we know that a #4 is better than a #3 or #2, but we don’t know–and cannot quantify–how much better it is.  For example, is the difference between “OK” and “Unhappy” the same as the difference between “Very Happy” and “Happy?”  We can’t say.
