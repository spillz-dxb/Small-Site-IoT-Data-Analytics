# SQL Subqueries and Temporary Tables

Both **subqueries** and **table expressions** are methods for being able to write a query that creates a table, and then writes a query that interacts with this new table. Sometimes the question you are trying to answer doesn't have an answer when working directly with existing tables in a database.

However, if we were able to create new tables from the existing tables, we know we could query these new tables to answer our question.

### Example:
We want to find the average number of events for each day for each channel. The first table will provide us the number of events for each day and channel, and then we will need to average these values together using a second query.

NOTE: Inner queries must be able to run on their own. They run **BEFORE** the outer query.

```
SELECT day, channel,
AVG(events) AS avg_event_count
FROM
(SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', occurred_at) as day, channel, COUNT(*) as events
FROM web_events
GROUP BY 1,2) sub
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC
```

## Single Value Subquery

In the first subquery, you created a table that you could then query again in the `FROM` statement. However, if you are **only returning a single value**, you might use that value in a logical statement like `WHERE`, `HAVING`, or even `SELECT` - the value could be nested within a `CASE` statement.

### Example

```
SELECT *
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) =
(SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month',MIN(occurred_at)) AS min_month
FROM orders)
ORDER BY occurred_at
```

NOTE: the inner query in the above example returns only a single value. This is why we can use a logical statement here like `WHERE`.

### Example

Use `DATE_TRUNC` to pull `month` level information about the first order ever placed in the `orders` table

```
SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) 
FROM orders;
```

Then to pull the average for each, we could do this all in one query, but for readability, I provided two queries below to perform each separately.

```
SELECT AVG(standard_qty) avg_std, AVG(gloss_qty) avg_gls, AVG(poster_qty) avg_pst
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
     (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);

SELECT SUM(total_amt_usd)
FROM orders
WHERE DATE_TRUNC('month', occurred_at) = 
      (SELECT DATE_TRUNC('month', MIN(occurred_at)) FROM orders);
```

## More Subquery

### Example 1

Provide the name of the **sales_rep** in each **region** with the largest amount of **total_amt_usd** sales.

First, I wanted to find the `total_amt_usd` totals associated with each sales rep, and I also wanted the region in which they were located. The query below provided this information.

```
SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY 1,2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

Next, I pulled the max for each region, and then we can use this to pull those rows in our final result.

```
SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1;
```

Essentially, this is a `JOIN` of these two tables, where the region and amount match.

```
SELECT t3.rep_name, t3.region_name, t3.total_amt
FROM(SELECT region_name, MAX(total_amt) total_amt
     FROM(SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY 1, 2) t1
     GROUP BY 1) t2
JOIN (SELECT s.name rep_name, r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
     FROM sales_reps s
     JOIN accounts a
     ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
     JOIN orders o
     ON o.account_id = a.id
     JOIN region r
     ON r.id = s.region_id
     GROUP BY 1,2
     ORDER BY 3 DESC) t3
ON t3.region_name = t2.region_name AND t3.total_amt = t2.total_amt;
```

### Example 2

For the region with the largest sales `total_amt_usd`, how many total orders were placed?

The first query I wrote was to pull the `total_amt_usd` for each `region`

```
SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name;
```

Then we just want the region with the max amount from this table. There are two ways I considered getting this amount. One was to pull the max using a subquery. Another way is to order descending and just pull the top value.

```
SELECT MAX(total_amt)
FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
             FROM sales_reps s
             JOIN accounts a
             ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
             JOIN orders o
             ON o.account_id = a.id
             JOIN region r
             ON r.id = s.region_id
             GROUP BY r.name) sub;
```

Finally, we want to pull the total orders for the region with this amount:

```
SELECT r.name, COUNT(o.total) total_orders
FROM sales_reps s
JOIN accounts a
ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
JOIN region r
ON r.id = s.region_id
GROUP BY r.name
HAVING SUM(o.total_amt_usd) = (
      SELECT MAX(total_amt)
      FROM (SELECT r.name region_name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) total_amt
              FROM sales_reps s
              JOIN accounts a
              ON a.sales_rep_id = s.id
              JOIN orders o
              ON o.account_id = a.id
              JOIN region r
              ON r.id = s.region_id
              GROUP BY r.name) sub);

```

This provides the **Northeast** with **2357** orders.

### Example 3

For the account that purchased the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) **standard_qty** paper, **how many accounts** still had more in **total** purchases? 

First, we want to find the account that had the most **standard_qty** paper. The query here pulls that account, as well as the total amount:

```
SELECT a.name account_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) total_std, SUM(o.total) total
FROM accounts a
JOIN orders o
ON o.account_id = a.id
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Now, I want to use this to pull all the accounts with more total sales:

```
SELECT a.name
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY 1
HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total 
                  FROM (SELECT a.name act_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) tot_std, SUM(o.total) total
                        FROM accounts a
                        JOIN orders o
                        ON o.account_id = a.id
                        GROUP BY 1
                        ORDER BY 2 DESC
                        LIMIT 1) sub);
```

This is now a list of all the accounts with more total orders. We can get the count with just another simple subquery.

```
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM (SELECT a.name
      FROM orders o
      JOIN accounts a
      ON a.id = o.account_id
      GROUP BY 1
      HAVING SUM(o.total) > (SELECT total 
                  FROM (SELECT a.name act_name, SUM(o.standard_qty) tot_std, SUM(o.total) total
                        FROM accounts a
                        JOIN orders o
                        ON o.account_id = a.id
                        GROUP BY 1
                        ORDER BY 2 DESC
                        LIMIT 1) inner_tab)
            ) counter_tab;
```

### Example 4

For the customer that spent the most (in total over their lifetime as a customer) **total_amt_usd**, how many **web_events** did they have for each channel?

Here, we first want to pull the customer with the most spent in lifetime value.

```
SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

Now, we want to look at the number of events on each channel this company had, which we can match with just the **id**.

```
SELECT a.name, w.channel, COUNT(*)
FROM accounts a
JOIN web_events w
ON a.id = w.account_id AND a.id =  (SELECT id
                     FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
                           FROM orders o
                           JOIN accounts a
                           ON a.id = o.account_id
                           GROUP BY a.id, a.name
                           ORDER BY 3 DESC
                           LIMIT 1) inner_table)
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 3 DESC;
```

I added an `ORDER BY` for no real reason, and the account name to assure I was only pulling from one account.

### Example 5

What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of **total_amt_usd** for the **top 10** total spending **accounts**?

First, we just want to find the top 10 accounts in terms of highest **total_amt_usd**.

```
SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id
GROUP BY a.id, a.name
ORDER BY 3 DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

Now, we just want the average of these 10 amounts.

```
SELECT AVG(tot_spent)
FROM (SELECT a.id, a.name, SUM(o.total_amt_usd) tot_spent
      FROM orders o
      JOIN accounts a
      ON a.id = o.account_id
      GROUP BY a.id, a.name
      ORDER BY 3 DESC
       LIMIT 10) temp;
```

### Example 6

What is the lifetime average amount spent in terms of **total_amt_us**d for only the companies that spent more than the average of all orders.

First, we want to pull the average of all accounts in terms of **total_amt_usd**:

```
SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
FROM orders o
JOIN accounts a
ON a.id = o.account_id;
```

Then, we want to only pull the accounts with more than this average amount.

```
SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd)
FROM orders o
GROUP BY 1
HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
                               FROM orders o
                               JOIN accounts a
                               ON a.id = o.account_id);
```

Finally, we just want the average of these values.

```
SELECT AVG(avg_amt)
FROM (SELECT o.account_id, AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_amt
    FROM orders o
    GROUP BY 1
    HAVING AVG(o.total_amt_usd) > (SELECT AVG(o.total_amt_usd) avg_all
                               FROM orders o
                               JOIN accounts a
                               ON a.id = o.account_id)) temp_table;
```
